## What Data is Preserved (by default)

If you choose **NOT** to remove data, the following will be kept:
- `data/` - Your session logs and training data
- `models/` - Your trained ML models
- `logs/` - Application logs

This allows you to reinstall later without losing your data.

## Complete Removal

To completely remove everything including data:

1. Run the uninstall script
2. When asked "Remove training data and session logs?", answer **y**
3. Delete the project folder

## Reinstallation

After uninstalling, you can reinstall anytime by:

1. Downloading the project again (or keeping the folder)
2. Running `setup.bat` (Windows) or `./setup.sh` (Linux/Mac)

If you preserved your data, your trained models and session history will still be available!

3. Desktop shortcut (if created)
4. Optionally: `data/`, `models/`, `logs/` folders
